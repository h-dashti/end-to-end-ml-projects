# End-to-End Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small, focused end-to-end machine learning projects. Each project follows a typical ML workflow: data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and (when applicable) saving the trained model.

The goal of this repo is to practice and showcase ML skills through hands-on examples across a variety of real-world datasets.
